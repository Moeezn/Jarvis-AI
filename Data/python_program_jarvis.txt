**Jarvis: A Virtual Assistant in Python**

Jarvis is a virtual assistant that can perform various tasks, such as setting reminders, sending emails, and providing information on various topics. Here's a basic implementation of Jarvis in Python:

**Features:**

1. **Speech Recognition**: Jarvis can recognize voice commands and perform tasks accordingly.
2. **Text-to-Speech**: Jarvis can convert text to speech and communicate with the user.
3. **Reminder**: Jarvis can set reminders for the user.
4. **Email**: Jarvis can send emails to the user's contacts.
5. **Information**: Jarvis can provide information on various topics, such as news, weather, and more.

**Requirements:**

1. **Python 3.x**: Jarvis requires Python 3.x to run.
2. **SpeechRecognition**: Jarvis uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize voice commands.
3. **pyttsx3**: Jarvis uses the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech.
4. **smtplib**: Jarvis uses the smtplib library to send emails.
5. **datetime**: Jarvis uses the datetime library to set reminders.

**Code:**
```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import smtplib
import datetime
import time

# Initialize the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines
r = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Define the Jarvis class
class Jarvis:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reminders = []

    def speak(self, text):
        engine.say(text)
        engine.runAndWait()

    def listen(self):
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            audio = r.listen(source)
            try:
                return r.recognize_google(audio, language="en-US")
            except sr.UnknownValueError:
                return None

    def set_reminder(self, reminder):
        self.reminders.append(reminder)
        self.speak("Reminder set for " + reminder)

    def send_email(self, to, subject, body):
        server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login("your_email@gmail.com", "your_password")
        server.sendmail("your_email@gmail.com", to, subject + "\n" + body)
        server.quit()
        self.speak("Email sent to " + to)

    def provide_info(self, topic):
        if topic == "news":
            self.speak("Here are the latest news headlines...")
            # Add news headlines here
        elif topic == "weather":
            self.speak("Here is the current weather...")
            # Add weather information here
        else:
            self.speak("I'm not sure what you mean by " + topic)

# Create a Jarvis instance
jarvis = Jarvis()

while True:
    # Listen for voice commands
    command = jarvis.listen()
    if command:
        # Set reminder
        if "set reminder" in command:
            reminder = command.split("set reminder for ")[1]
            jarvis.set_reminder(reminder)
        # Send email
        elif "send email" in command:
            to = command.split("send email to ")[1].split(" with subject ")[0]
            subject = command.split(" with subject ")[1].split(" and body ")[0]
            body = command.split(" and body ")[1]
            jarvis.send_email(to, subject, body)
        # Provide information
        elif "what is" in command:
            topic = command.split("what is ")[1]
            jarvis.provide_info(topic)
        # Quit
        elif "quit" in command:
            break
        else:
            jarvis.speak("I didn't understand that command")
    else:
        jarvis.speak("I didn't hear anything")
```
**Example Use Cases:**

1. **Set Reminder**: "Jarvis, set reminder for 3 PM"
2. **Send Email**: "Jarvis, send email to John with subject Hello and body How are you?"
3. **Provide Information**: "Jarvis, what is the news?"
4. **Quit**: "Jarvis, quit"

Note: This is a basic implementation of Jarvis, and you can add more features and functionality as per your requirements. Additionally, you'll need to replace the placeholder email and password with your actual Gmail credentials.
