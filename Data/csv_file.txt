**Sample CSV File for Medical AI Data**

Here's a sample CSV file structure for medical AI data:

```csv
"Patient_ID","Age","Sex","Diagnosis","Treatment","Outcome"
"001","25","Male","Diabetes","Metformin","Improved"
"002","30","Female","Hypertension","Lisinopril","Stable"
"003","40","Male","Cancer","Surgery","Recovered"
"004","35","Female","Asthma","Inhaler","Managed"
"005","45","Male","Cardiovascular Disease","Stent","Improved"
```

This CSV file contains the following columns:

1. **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient
2. **Age**: Patient's age
3. **Sex**: Patient's sex (Male/Female)
4. **Diagnosis**: Patient's diagnosis (e.g., Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer)
5. **Treatment**: Treatment prescribed to the patient (e.g., Metformin, Lisinopril, Surgery)
6. **Outcome**: Patient's outcome (e.g., Improved, Stable, Recovered, Managed)

**Example Use Case**

Suppose we want to analyze the relationship between patient age and diagnosis. We can use the CSV file to create a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and diagnosis on the y-axis. This can help us identify patterns and trends in the data.

**Code Example (Python)**
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("medical_data.csv")

# Create a scatter plot
plt.scatter(df["Age"], df["Diagnosis"])
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Diagnosis")
plt.title("Age vs. Diagnosis")
plt.show()
```

This code loads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, creates a scatter plot using matplotlib, and displays the plot.

**Data Dictionary**

Here's a data dictionary for the CSV file:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patient_ID | string | Unique identifier for each patient |
| Age | integer | Patient's age |
| Sex | string | Patient's sex (Male/Female) |
| Diagnosis | string | Patient's diagnosis (e.g., Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer) |
| Treatment | string | Treatment prescribed to the patient (e.g., Metformin, Lisinopril, Surgery) |
| Outcome | string | Patient's outcome (e.g., Improved, Stable, Recovered, Managed) |

Note: The data dictionary provides a detailed description of each column in the CSV file, including the data type and a brief description of the data.
