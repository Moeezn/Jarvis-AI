**Code Examples**

1. **Image Generation using Python and OpenCV**:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Generate a random image
img = np.random.rand(256, 256, 3)

# Save the image to a file
cv2.imwrite('random_image.png', img)
```
2. **Image Analysis using Python and TensorFlow**:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img

# Load an image from a file
img = load_img('image.jpg')

# Analyze the image using a pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.applications.VGG16()
predictions = model.predict(img)
```
3. **Image Manipulation using Python and Pillow**:
```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

# Load an image from a file
img = Image.open('image.jpg')

# Apply a filter to the image
img = img.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur)

# Save the image to a file
img.save('blurred_image.jpg')
```
