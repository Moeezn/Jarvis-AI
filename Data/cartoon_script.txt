(The scene opens with Max and Sam sitting in their secret hideout, a cozy little cave behind a waterfall. Max is tinkering with a gadget, while Sam is lounging on a nearby rock.)

Max: (excitedly) I've got it, Sam! I've finally figured out how to crack the code to Dr. Vortex's secret cheese vault!

Sam: (skeptically) Uh, Max, why do we need to steal cheese from Dr. Vortex? Can't we just buy some at the market?

Max: (determined) No way, Sam! Dr. Vortex has the world's most expensive and exotic cheeses in his vault. We need to get our paws on them to save the city from his evil cheese-stealing plans!

**Scene 2: The Heist**

(Max and Sam sneak into Dr. Vortex's lair, avoiding traps and guards along the way. They finally reach the cheese vault, where they find a dazzling array of cheeses from around the world.)

Max: (awed) Wow, Sam! Look at all this cheese! We're going to be the richest mice in the city!

Sam: (impressed) Yeah, and we're going to need a bigger hideout to store all this loot!

(Just as they're about to grab the cheese, Dr. Vortex appears, cackling maniacally.)

Dr. Vortex: (menacingly) Ah-ah, Max and Sam! You'll never get away with my precious cheese! My robot guards will stop you!

(Dr. Vortex summons his robot guards, who chase Max and Sam through the lair.)

**Scene 3: The Chase**

(Max and Sam run and jump through the lair, dodging laser beams and robot guards. They use their quick thinking and cunning to outsmart their pursuers.)

Max: (shouting) Sam, take out that robot with your catnip spray!

Sam: (spraying catnip) Got it, Max!

(The robot guard sneezes and stumbles, giving Max and Sam time to escape.)

**Scene 4: The Final Confrontation**

(Max and Sam finally reach the exit, but Dr. Vortex blocks their way.)

Dr. Vortex: (furious) You'll never leave my lair alive, Max and Sam!

Sam: (laughing) And we got all the cheese we could ever want!
