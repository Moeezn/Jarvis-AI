In cervical dystonia, the involuntary muscle contractions can lead to abnormal postures and limited range of motion in the neck. Physical therapy exercises can help improve neck mobility and reduce stiffness. These exercises may include:\n\n1. Gentle stretching to improve flexibility\n2. Strengthening exercises to improve muscle balance\n3. Range of motion exercises to maintain or improve neck mobility\n4. Posture correction to reduce strain on the neck muscles.\n\nA physical therapist can create a customized exercise program to address specific limitations and improve overall neck function."

In the context of cervical myopathy or cervical dystonia, surgical interventions may be considered in severe cases that are resistant to other treatments. The goal of surgery is to relieve muscle spasms, improve posture, and restore normal neck function.\n\nSome surgical options for cervical dystonia include:\n\n1. Selective denervation: This involves cutting or removing specific nerves that are responsible for the abnormal muscle contractions.\n2. Deep brain stimulation: This procedure involves implanting an electrode in the brain to deliver electrical impulses that can help regulate muscle activity.\n3. Muscle resection: In this procedure, the affected muscles are partially or completely removed to relieve spasms and improve neck mobility.\n\nSurgery is usually considered a last resort and is typically recommended for patients who have not responded to other treatments. A neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon can help determine if surgery is an appropriate option for a specific individual."
