EXT. MAGICAL KINGDOM - DAY

The camera pans over a beautiful, vibrant kingdom filled with rolling hills, sparkling lakes, and towering castles.

LUNA (12)
(excitedly)
Oh, Leo! Look! A dragon!

LEO (10)
(equally excited)
Whoa! Let's go check it out!

The siblings approach the dragon, who is sleeping peacefully.

LUNA
(whispering)
Shh, Leo. We don't want to wake it up.

LEO
(whispering back)
But what if it's friendly?

Suddenly, the dragon wakes up and roars loudly.

LUNA
(startled)
Ah! It's awake!

LEO
(bravely)
Don't worry, Luna. I've got an idea.

Leo pulls out a small bag of treats and offers them to the dragon.

DRAGON
(in a deep, rumbling voice)
Hmmph. You think a few treats will calm me down?

LUNA
(nervously)
Uh, yeah. We just wanted to be friends.

The dragon chuckles and begins to eat the treats.

DRAGON
(with a mouthful of treats)
Alright, alright. You two are okay. My name is Blaze, by the way.

LUNA
(smiling)
Nice to meet you, Blaze.

LEO
(equally friendly)
Yeah, we're Luna and Leo.

Blaze finishes the treats and belches loudly.

BLAZE
(satisfied)
Ah, that hit the spot. Now, what brings you two to our kingdom?

LUNA
(excitedly)
We're on a quest to find the legendary Golden Acorn!

LEO
(equally excited)
Yeah, we heard it's hidden deep within the kingdom.

BLAZE
(impressed)
Ah, you two are brave. The Golden Acorn is indeed a treasure worth seeking. But be warned, the journey will be treacherous.

LUNA
(determined)
We're not afraid. We'll face whatever challenges come our way.

LEO
(equally determined)
Yeah, we're a team.

Blaze nods in approval.

BLAZE
(smiling)
I like your spirit. I'll give you a map that will lead you to the Golden Acorn. But be warned, you're not the only ones after it.

LUNA
(determined)
We'll be careful. Thanks, Blaze.

LEO
(equally grateful)
Yeah, thanks for the map.

The siblings set off on their journey, ready to face whatever challenges come their way.

FADE OUT.
