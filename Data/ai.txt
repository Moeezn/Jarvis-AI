2. **Reasoning**: AI systems can draw inferences and make decisions based on available data.
3. **Problem-Solving**: AI systems can solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
4. **Perception**: AI systems can interpret and understand data from sensors, such as images, speech, and text.

**Types of AI**

1. **Narrow or Weak AI**: Designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition or language translation.
2. **General or Strong AI**: A hypothetical AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks.
3. **Superintelligence**: An AI system that is significantly more intelligent than the best human minds.

**AI Techniques**

1. **Machine Learning (ML)**: A type of AI that involves training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions.
2. **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML that uses neural networks to analyze data.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.
4. **Computer Vision**: A field of AI that deals with the interpretation and understanding of visual data from images and videos.

**AI Applications**

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(4,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Evaluate model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

**AI Best Practices**
