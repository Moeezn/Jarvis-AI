Here is a cartoon strip I came up with:

**Title:** "The Adventures of Max and Sam"

**Panel 1:**
[Image of a city street with two friends, Max and Sam, walking together]
Max: "Hey Sam, have you heard about the new amusement park that just opened up?"
Sam: "No, what's it called?"
Max: "Thrillville! I heard it's the best one in the country."

**Panel 2:**
[Image of Max and Sam standing in front of the Thrillville entrance, looking excited]
Max: "We're finally here! Let's go check it out."
Sam: "I'm so down! I love roller coasters."

**Panel 3:**
[Image of Max and Sam on a roller coaster, screaming with excitement]
Max: "Wheeee! This is insane!"
Sam: "Ahh! My stomach is dropping!"

**Panel 4:**
[Image of Max and Sam walking away from the roller coaster, laughing]
Max: "That was amazing! What's next?"
Sam: "Let's try the Ferris wheel. I love the view from the top."

**Panel 5:**
[Image of Max and Sam at the top of the Ferris wheel, looking out at the city]
Max: "Wow, you can see the whole city from up here."
Sam: "It's beautiful. I'm so glad we came to Thrillville today."

**Panel 6:**
[Image of Max and Sam walking out of the amusement park, exhausted but happy]
Max: "That was the best day ever. Thanks for coming with me, Sam."
Sam: "No problem, Max. Let's do it again soon."

THE END.
